// Part of 1fx. Mod version 0.80 and higher.
// This is the mapcycle file, this file will be executed
// at the start of the server in order to load a map.

// In order to only have one map load instead of
// multiple maps, you can remove the map1 and map2
// entry from this file. You would also have to set
// the desired gametype, time- and scorelimit CVARs
// and change the g_motd CVAR from the map0 entry.

// Choices for gametypes are:
// dm, tdm, ctf, inf, elim, h&s or h&z
